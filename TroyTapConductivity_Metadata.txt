<Summary> 
	This data set contains 131 measurements of tap water conductivity in 
	microsiemens/cm from plumbing fixtures throughout Troy, New York. The
	measurements were mainly made on the Rensselaer and Sage campuses due 
	to ease of access. Along with the conductivity measured at each fixture,
	the temperature in degrees celsius, location description of fixture, 
	fixture type (sink or drinking fountain), year of building construction,
	and time (24-hour)and date (mm/dd/yyyy) of each measurement is included. 
	The geoJSON consists of georeferenced points using the WGS 84 coordinate 
	refrence system. 

	The data was collected with the intent to examine potential differences in 
	tap water throughout Troy, NY as a result of the tap water traveling from 
	the John P. Buckley Water Treatment Plant, through the distribution system, 
	and into Troy buildings and homes (i.e. if the treated water came into contact 
	with lead pipes and lead ions were added to solution). Using this data set, an 
	investigator could examine correlations between conductivity measurements, year 
	of building construction, geographic location, etc. 

	General Procedure for Data Collection:
	1. Locate fixture
	2. Write ID of sample in physical notebook (1,2,3,...)
	3. Obtain GPS coordinates with gvSIG Mini phone app and record (lat, long)
		This approach to collecting GPs coordinates was abandoned - phone
		was proven to be unreliable. GPS coordinates were closely 
		approximated post-collection.
	4. Record type of fixture, location description, year of building construction 
	   (if known), time + date of collection (from phone clock/calendar)
	5. Turn on tap (cold) and rinse probe and container with tap water
	6. Collect water in plastic sample container
	7. Turn on probe and put probe in sample
	8. Wait until probe reading stabilizes (approx. 30 sec) and record values for 
	   both temperature and conductivity
	9. Pour sample down sink and find next fixture

	An ORION Conductivity Meter Model 135 was used to make the conductivity and
	temperature measurements. A built in temperature function (nLF) corrected the
	conductivity measurement display to a 25 degrees celsius reference temprature.
	Specifications for probe can be found in the later "Additional Information" 
	section in this file.

<Quality>
	The measurements in this data set were conducted in a manner that is not
	compliant with EPA quality assurance standards. For example, only one 
	measurement was taken at each fixture. Repeated measurements would need 
	to be made to improve the quality of the data set. 

<Use_Constraints>
	The measurements that comprise this data set are not compliant to EPA 
	quality assurance standards and should not be used for any serious 
	investigation into tap water quality in Troy, NY.  The data set should 
	not be used for anything further than to satisfy the casual curiosity 
	of its potential users. Should it be discovered that there are concerning 
	measurements of conductivity in the data set, a more legitimate investigation 
	by the appropriate, qualified, and certified officials should be conducted.

Additional Information 
(Not following DIF standard)

Information about Investigator, Technical Contact, and DIF Author:
	Alexandra Evans is a fifth year co-terminal student at Rensselaer
	Polytechnic Institute in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department
	studying Geology. She was taught how to properly use the ORION Conductivity
	Meter Model 135 by her research advisor prior to making the measurements in
	this data set. 

Provenance of Data Set:
	Data set was originally written on paper in ink in a composition notebook. The
	information was then transcribed into Microsoft Excel and saved as a CSV file.
	The GPS coordinates of the individual samples were closely approximated using
	the location descriptions recorded in the notebook. The sample locations were
	marked as vector points in QGIS using an OpenStreetMap layer as reference. The
	vector points were then saved as an ESRI shapefile. The CSV was imported into
	QGIS and joined with the ESRI shapefile. The new shapefile with the updated
	attribute table was then saved and exported as a GeoSJON. 

ORION Conductivity Meter Model 135 Specifications:
	Temperature Resolution: 0.1 degree C
	Temperature Range: -5 to 99.9 degrees C
	Temperature Compensation: Compensation of Natural Water (nLF)
	nLF Accuracy: 0.5 percent of Measurement Value +/- 1 Digit for Test Sample
		temperature -5 C to +99.9 C
	Temperature Accuracy: 0.1 C +/- Digit at Operating Temperature (-10 C to +55 C)
	Conductivity Range Mode: 0 to 1999 microsiemens/cm
	Resolution of Conductivity Range: 1 microsiemen/cm
